### Project H — First-Time Contributor Experience & AI-Assisted Security Guide

**One line:** Security-first onboarding, documentation clarity, and an AI-assisted guide to help contributors understand BLT and OWASP expectations before contributing.

**Description:**
Improves BLT’s first-time contributor experience by addressing onboarding, navigation, and documentation gaps that lead to insecure or low-quality contributions. The project introduces a clear 
“start here” walkthrough for new users, security-focused information architecture, and contribution clarity pages that explain what qualifies as a security contribution and why PRs may be rejected.
Includes a constrained, explain-only AI Security Guide embedded into the website that answers contributor questions in beginner-friendly language using BLT documentation, GitHub Discussions, 
and OWASP public resources (e.g. OWASP Top 10, Cheat Sheet Series). The AI does not review code, analyze diffs, approve PRs, or generate exploit guidance; it is strictly scoped to explanation, 
clarification, and linking to authoritative sources.

**Key components:**
- First-time user walkthrough (“New to BLT? Start Here”) explaining BLT’s security focus, contribution flow, common beginner mistakes, and next steps
- Security-focused navigation and page annotations to distinguish beginner paths from advanced tools and apps
- Documentation surfacing and fixes (repair broken links, define canonical entry points)
- Contribution clarity pages (e.g. “What counts as a security contribution?”, “Why PRs get rejected”)
- Embedded AI Security Guide for contextual, beginner-friendly explanations grounded in BLT + OWASP content
