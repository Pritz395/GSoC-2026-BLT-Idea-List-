### Project C — blt-education Platform (standalone)

**One line:** Tiered learning tracks, hands-on labs, auto-quizzes, and instructor review workflows.

**Description:** Structured security education: Beginner → Intermediate → Trusted tracks, 4–6 labs, auto-grading, instructor review queue, and optional badge-based unlocks. High content and mentoring load; best when education/content capacity exists.
